---
### My dissertation focused on radionuclide transport modeling coupled with bentonite extrusion

![Fracture domain](img/fracture.domain.jpg)

**Repository safety could be enhanced**  
I derived the two models, coupled, assembled FEM solution  
Highly sorbing radionuclides confined in the bentonite extrusion region  

Also as part of postdoctorate research at Todai

## UI at Idaho Falls is an interesting situation

Nontraditional is probably the best term

Main campus 550 miles

Technically, only 3 NE faculty though a lot of 'affiliates'

It's challenging but difficult because I can do what I want 

No one currently at Associate level

Resources can be limited

### Selected research pathways

#### (with many pictures)
---
class: center,middle

## Safeguardability
### Safeguards-by-design

#### Started at UC-Berkeley with Per Peterson, Joonhong Ahn, KAERI
---
### At UCB - developed a holistic, top-down methodology

Commercial pyroprocessing facility example system

Intended to apply to other nuclear materials facilities

**Proliferation resistance**  
Develop functional components to facility design

**Physical protection**  
Take advantage of inherent design features

**Systems assessment = Safeguardability quantification**  
Risk-informed approach

Time may have passed me by, but I still want to develop it

---
### Part 1 - Use of MCNP to estimate wall thickness

![facility](img/facility.jpg)
---
### Will TRU processing state affect safeguardability?

1 - ERD metal+salt  
1a - ERD metal   
2 - U+TRU+salt   
3 - TRU+salt  
3a - TRU+Cd  
4 - U/TRU alloy  

SDEF - Cm-244 watt spectrum 

TRU processing states are not self-protecting under IAEA standard  

Wall thickness on par with other analogues (less than $10 \mu Sv/h$)  
Average 30 cm - 45 cm thickness concrete 

Maintenance, storage buffers located in proximity to process cells  
Material transfer paths and facility footprint reduced
---
### Part 2 - Apply discrete event simulation to facility design

![DES fuel fabrication 1](img/des_fuel1.jpg)
---
### Discrete event simulation describes state changes of system variables over time

![DES fuel fabrication 2](img/des_fuel2.jpg)
---
### Discrete event simulation lends itself well to object oriented programming

This is what I think is the key to safeguards-by-design

Jieun revamped the code

Model flow of Pu for each processing state; different times, batch size

Determine materials accounting due to operation, failure, maintenance

Connect to Type I error

$\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha)+\Phi^{-1}(1-\beta)=\frac{SQ}{\sigma}$
---
### What can discrete simulation say about safeguardability (in terms of design)?

Results showed material flow not a function of equipment failure

Safeguardability shown as a function of material flow and design

For these proposed designs, operational goals are not affected - equal campaigns

SEID less than 2.4 kg for varying $1-\beta$

First build that showed designs can be evaluated quantitatively

Jieun then added error propagation and increased accounting 

First build calculated inventory difference at end of campaign

Now, at end of every material balance area/unit process

### We also performed a hazard operability analysis

Specialized form of risk assessment

Process flow diagrams developed for -  
1. Voloxidation
2. Electroreduction, electrorefining, electrowinning
3. Ar atmosphere control system 

Operational deviation analysis within the context of safeguard-by-design

Different hot cells for electroreduction and electrorefining (different salts)

Because low pressure possible salt leak could ruin materials accounting

Really forces you to understand systems at a very deep level

Actually really interesting to do

Funding

Development of a GUI

Which we have capabilities for already

### How can cyber vulnerabilities be integrated into traditional risk assessment? 

Cyberattacks against critical energy infrastructure have gone from possible to eventual to actual

Plant modernization -----> digitization

Not just control panel

NRC wants stronger cybersecurity at plants but doesn't really know what that looks like

Emerging field with a lot of latitude to develop solutions 

(That is what I say when reviewers argue with me)
---
### Cyberattacks will act on many vectors

That means one type of attack can be used for multiple systems 

We take the position that actually 'hacking the reactor' is unlikely

Forcing operator to trip or vent steam will cost a lot of money 

There will also be a lot of down time to investigate the attack

Losses of several million dollars per year

I&C systems must be resilient to cyber domain threats, and guide operators with clear, prioritized information to make distinctions between safety events and cyber-based instrument manipulation
---
### We reviewed past cyber events at nuclear installations 

Davis-Besse, Browns Ferry, Hatch

Other non nuclear events - Ukraine, SF muni (they hacked it to actually run on time)

**Commonalities**   
Insufficient cybersecurity features  
Unintentional circumvention of facility security measures  
Unknowing insider participation  

These were not hacks - deficiencies in effective security policies  

What happens when there is a directed attack?
---
### We need a modernized definition of risk 

Cyberattacks are deliberate - frequency is 1

Risk associated with digitization related to the strength of their defenses and their connectivity with other systems

Means that common cause or cascading type 'failures' (attacks) increase risk

Traditional PRA kind of breaks down at this point

Solutions still should be within a performance based (vendor agnostic) context
---
### We also modeled a man in the middle attack for a plant

Boron monitoring system setpoint 

![Boron monitoring system](img/bms.jpg)

Showed 2 out of 3 circuit could mitigate the attack 
---
### Cybersecurity - what capabilities are needed?

Someone who can and likes to code  

Funding

Replicating past cyberattacks into WSC simulator

Development of new envelope of attacks as a design basis

I&C design and testing

Situational awareness (which is a human factors issue)

Interface with INL HSSL (with Ron, Katya et al.)

### Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission

### State of Idaho Department of Commerce

#### Used fuel cask with Sakae Casting, LLC (Ibaraki)
---
### IGEM funds products to market

Collaboration with UIdaho, Boise State, Sakae

Sakae has unique aluminum casting capabilities

We proposed an intermediate storage cask of borated aluminum

UIdaho - Neutrons, heat removal, regulations

Boise St - Materials science - solid solution of $B_4C$ and $Al$

IGEM is a typical proposal process

Everyone gets up in your business

Present to the IGEM council and they vote on it
---
### We argue some used fuel pools filling up

Assemblies need several years cooling before transfer to standard dry casks

Understand that some are transferred sooner - not necessarily internationally

Design a cask pool and dry storage

I did the market research (IGEM requirement) 

Turns out hard numbers on used fuel pool capacities were really hard to find

Active NPP nations that are once through and not phasing out

For the most part, Europe doesn't seem to be a potential market

Most Asian countries lack robust dry storage

United States could go either way
---
### I used ORIGEN for burnup and depletion

Thanks to Steve Skutnik for help

Divided the cases in to low burnup, typical burnup, high burnup  

Based on literature review

(Read - N-XXYY - X.X% and YY GWD/MTU)

L-3030, T-4045, H-5060

Westinghouse 17x17 PWR  

515 day cycle length and pool cooling (decay) from discharge out to 20 years
---
class: middle,center
![Decay heat per assembly](img/Decay heat of used fuel per assembly.png)
---
### Then I ran many many many MCNP simulations for dose rate

I decided that the cask probably would only be useful for older fuel (20 y)

ORIGEN shows Cm-244 to be dominant emitter across the board (SDEF)

Plate thickness - 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 18, 30 cm

$B_4C$ - 10, 30, 50, 70, 90 wt% in Al per plate thickness

$^{10}B$ loading in $B_4C$ - 5, 10, 25, 50, 75 wt%

For each enrichment-burnup

Then a second set of simulations emplaced in concrete - 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 cm

Looking for plate thickness for dose rate below $10 \mu Sv/h$

### More MCNP modeling notes for your interest

Backfill - air, water, helium, borosilicate glass

Lattice card 17x17 unit cells - 269 rods - pitch 12.54 mm

Material card taken from ORIGEN output with 1E-08 wt% cutoff

Standard defaults for dose card

SDEF card - 5 source points per rod (POS)

ERG = Spontaneous Cm fission energy distribution

F2 tally for outward normal on each plate

NPS 2E6 (bare) and 3E6 (container) passed all tests

Equal dose rates off plates - isotropic
---
![L-3030 air glass](img/l3030_air_glass.png)
---
### What do the results mean for design? 

I don't know the cost of $^{10}B$

Sakae needs to figure out limits of plate casting 

Use of water backfill may be criticality risk if there are multiple casks

12 wt% $B_4C$ constraint for now

High burnup fuel may not be feasible
---
### I suggested NRC certification to enhance marketability

Currently 4 companies have obtained compliance each with different models

NUHOMS, MAGNASTOR, HI-STAR, HI-STORM (51 total)

10CFR72 is the relevant regulation

In short, the regulation is highly performance based

Demonstrate subcriticality, heat removal, occupational safety, etc.

Much of 10CFR72 is devoted to QA, which we can't do at this time

Application for Phase II design under review 
---
### Cask design - what capabilities are needed? 

MCNP a lot

Cost analysis

Safety analysis 

Establishing new quality assurance and quality control

Casting, but that is Sakae

Materials science
