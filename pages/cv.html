[*Collaborative open source curriculum development*](https://necx-org.github.io/)  
This workshop concluded a year of faculty interaction at six universities to develop curricula for courses common across the same disciplines at multiple universities in order to reduce the amount of time that any individual professor spends on creating what is essentially duplicate materials. The method proposed in this workshop is based on open source software development, where code is shared in online repositories, reviewed by peers, and contributed to the main project.

**Generation Atomic + GAIN - Nuclear Advocacy and Communications Training**  
**Facilitator**  
Opposition groups repeatedly claim that nuclear power plants are unsafe. Recently, the U.S. nuclear power industry has been characterized as too expensive and dangerous when compared to other energy sources. As members of the nuclear community, we know that the success of nuclear energy has never been more important to ensuring a positive future for the world – but what can we do to make a difference? This workshop will leave participants energized to tell today’s nuclear power story and be well-equipped with the tools to do so.  Convincing others about the benefits of nuclear involves more than just laying out the facts. Thoughtful and personal storytelling bridges gaps when speaking those who are unfamiliar with the technology by explaining the personal and moral reasons that we work in this field. Telling our personal stories and motivations for working in nuclear creates common ground from which we can better explain nuclear’s benefits: whether it’s as a mother talking to a father, a surfer talking to a skier, or a cook talking to a conservationist, the human stories that nuclear makes possible are our strongest tools when speaking to the public. The most effective nuclear advocacy takes place at the interpersonal level when we strike up conversations with peers and even better, strangers. Because you can never know who it might be sitting across from you at that dinner party or next to you on the airplane, it’s important to practice having open, considerate conversations with people of all backgrounds.

*Cyber Security Course for Safeguards Practitioners*  
The course is designed for early to mid-career safeguards practitioners (technical instrument developers, instru­ment users, policy advisors, etc.) who will benefit from a greater understanding of cyber security threats and how to reduce risks to safeguards systems and processes. This 3.5 day course is designed to teach safeguards and cybersecurity experts how to recognize and mitigate potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities in emerging safeguards instrumentation, information systems, and conduct of operations. This training features classroom style learning opportunities through hands-on exercises and provides plenty of time for questions and discussion. Participants will learn new cyber security skills, use cyber security tools, and collaborate with one another and cyber experts to resolve challenges. They will gain an understanding of cyber security principles and a better awareness of cyber risks associated with safeguards systems. Exercises will include puzzles, exploits of attended and unattended monitoring systems, blended physical and cyber attacks on fictional nuclear facilities, and network defense.

The school is being organized through the cooperation of national laboratories, industry, government agencies, and universities that share the goal of building a strong workforce to support global nuclear expansion. The faculty will be drawn from the top experts in academia, industry, and government. The general organization and conduct of the school will be overseen by an international board of senior experts. A local secretariat will provide technical, logistical and administrative support to students and faculty. It is the aim of the school to foster the development of a next-generation network of scientists and engineers capable of advancing nuclear energy in the 21st century through integrated
modeling and experimentation.

*Collaborative open source curriculum development*  
This workshop included faculty at six universities to develop curricula for courses common across the same disciplines at multiple universities in order to reduce the amount of time that any individual professor spends on creating what is essentially duplicate materials. The method proposed in this workshop is based on open source software development, where code is shared in online repositories, reviewed by peers, and contributed to the main project.

**Participant**  
*Consent-Based Siting Public Meeting*  
The Department of Energy is in the initial phase of developing a consent-based process for siting the facilities needed to store and dispose of the nation’s spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  A consent-based approach to siting relies on understanding the views of the public, stakeholders, and governments at the local, state, and tribal levels.  In this first phase, the Department is engaging with interested groups and individuals to learn about what elements are important to consider in designing an enduring approach to siting.  This session is an opportunity for the public to share thoughts and perspectives through a facilitated discussion.

*Trilateral Nuclear Energy Dialogue: Korea, Japan, United States*  
Convene a high-level private workshop among preeminent Korean, Japanese, and American experts in nuclear energy and nuclear policy issues, with the intention of fostering relationships, confidence building, and seeking potential areas for trilateral cooperation. In keeping with the overarching theme of previous discussions—the back-end fuel cycle—this meeting seeks to underscore the role of advanced nuclear energy and fuel cycle technologies. Although the obstacles impeding permanent solutions to spent fuel and radioactive waste are largely political, this dialogue aims to highlight the potential of cutting-edge technologies in addressing the policy, environmental, and public acceptance challenges facing management of the nuclear fuel cycle, in addition to opportunities for international collaboration in the research, development, demonstration, and deployment of such technologies.

*Proliferation Resistance and Physical Protection Working Group Workshop*  
The PR&PP methodology was developed within the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) to provide a structured framework to assess the proliferation resistance and physical protection robustness of Gen IV nuclear energy systems, and to guide designers to further improve their systems. This workshop is intended to familiarize non-experts in this field with the broad aspects of the methodology and its applications. The PR&PP Working Group will present an overview of the methodology to an audience of  students, academics, and members of the GIF community who wish to become more familiar with the PR&PP methodology. To illustrate the methodology, its application to a hypothetical nuclear energy system will be examined. Workshop participants will be divided into subgroups that will consider different proliferation and security threats, and will identify important design features and approaches that contribute to the system’s resilience to these threats. Following these subgroup sessions, workshop participants will reconvene to review insights from the subgroups. Finally, an open discussion will be held to obtain feedback from the participants on the GIF approach to PR&PP with the objective of refining the methodology and its presentation to the wider community of academics and prospective GIF users.

*Open educational resources development*  
This workshop focused on the use of open source educational materials in order to produce an online textbook as a supplement to existing commercial textbooks. An online textbook allows flexibility for faculty to augment content without requiring multiple textbooks for a course. An online textbook allows the educational content of a course to be more closely aligned with the desired learning outcomes. Two online texts have been developed: Principles of Nuclear Engineering and Risk Assessment.

*Minner fellows program*  
The objective of this program was to develop a framework for making ethical judgments in engineering. Because engineering faculty and graduate students play a leadership role in the development of these technologies, it is essential that they become aware the ethical, legal and social ramifications of them. The course focused on context, or the embodiment of moral maturity and ethical expertise, in the same way that faculty and graduate students embody engineering and technical expertise.
